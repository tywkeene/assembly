# assembly
Various small programs and algorithms implemented in x86 and ARM assembly language

Nothing in this repository should be considered useful or complete, this is purely me playing with different architectures and attempting to optimize down common algorithms.

Comments and pull requests are welcome. If you see something I did wrong, or would like to teach me something, please do. I will also add it to a markdown file and credit you so everyone can learn.
